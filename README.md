# JobSity
Data Engineering Challenge

This desktop application was developed with Visual Satudio 2019 in C#. You must use this IDE to open and run the project.

But you don't need really open the project There is a video "JobSit3.mp4" which demonstrates the app.

The app is just a simulation of  some hypotetic process which could be running on the cloud.

In fact, the challenge could be solved just with parametrizations using resources that are already availabel on the cloud.

There is a complete and expanding ecosystem.

The process starts with the Data Factory.
In our case, the Data Factory mission is bringing external sources like the CSV files to the process.
Given that each CSV file arrived it will flow through the pipeline and be transformed in rows of some data table inside some relational data base.

Of course, all these features are capable to deal with much more complex situations. For example: parallelism.
One of the fundamentals patterns in the bigdata context is MapReduce:
“MapReduce is an essential program model to support parallel computation on large collection of data in computer clusters.”

On the client side, the beneficiaries of the polished data, are tools and IDEs which connect to the services on cloud and make statistical analyses and queries over the datasets.

On the client side in general I use programming in C#, Python and R.
