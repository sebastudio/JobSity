# JobSity
Data Engineering Challenge

There are 2 C# .Net projects and 1 video:

- JobSityChallenge => Web api application (.net core),
- TripDE => Desktop application, WPF,
- Video JobSity.mp4 => Explanation about my solution. 

To execute the applications the best way is through Visual Satudio 2019. You must use this IDE to open and run the project.

But you don't need really open the any project. The video "JobSit.mp4" demonstrates the apps.
