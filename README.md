# JobSity
Data Engineering Challenge

There are 2 C# .Net projects and 1 video:

- JobSityChallenge => Web api application (.net core 5.0);
- TripDE => Desktop application (WPF) - Just for visual and animated simulation of the technology;
- Video JobSity.mp4 => The bigdata technology behind the solution. 

To execute the applications the best way is through Visual Satudio 2019. You must use this IDE to open and run the project.

In case of any issue to open the projects, the video "JobSit.mp4" demonstrates the apps.

*** Check List ***

Mandatory Features
● There must be an automated process to ingest and store the data. (Prototype)
● Trips with similar origin, destination, and time of day should be grouped together. (Prototype)
● Develop a way to obtain the weekly average number of trips for an area, defined by a
bounding box (given by coordinates) or by a region. (Prototype)
● Develop a way to inform the user about the status of the data ingestion without using a
polling solution. (Prototype)
● The solution should be scalable to 100 million entries. It is encouraged to simplify the
data by a data model. Please add proof that the solution is scalable. (Prototype)
● Use a SQL database (Prototype)

Bonus features
● Containerize your solution. (Incomplete)
● Sketch up how you would set up the application using any cloud provider (AWS, Google
Cloud, etc). (video "JobSit.mp4")
